# Inspiration \*

It's important to record what inspiration led to the decision to develop the project.  
Oftentimes after some work you may decide something is not working but be unable to identify what it is.  
In this cases you can:

* Look back at what inspired you and see if you are diverging from what was expected.
* Show the source of inspiration to the team \(or some friends\) and see how they react and compare to it what is being developed.
* Ask the team for similar inspirations and consider what is given.
* Check if what inspired you still gives you a strong reaction, or if it has lost some of it's impact. Maybe it was a trend that has faded out, or the market has become saturated with similar games.

## What inspired to start making your game?

* Making a personal version of something that exists on the market?
* Remaking an old game for current tech/tendencies?
* Answering a market need \(niche\) that you identify with?
* Seeing or hearing something that inspired you?
* Seeing or hearing something that isn't working and you can make better?

## How to find additional inspiration?

* **Stop work on the game** Choose to give yourself a vacation where you wont work in the game. \(ex. an extended weekend Friday, Saturday, Sunday\) Most times you will find some random thoughts come to you, just record them on your phone and let them go. After the specified time review your thoughts, organize them and compare them to what your doing. 
* **Explain it to someone else:** Ask someone not involved with the project to listen to you explain the game. Usually the thought process of explaining the details will provide some insights, and the feedback the other person gives can point out new ideas or just point something that needs to be clearer. 
* **Use mechanics outside of the genre:**   
  Are there some challenges that you could borrow to influence your game?

  *  Resource management in a platformer?
  * Quick-time puzzle in an adventure/clue game?

  Make a deck of various game mechanics from various genres and try to find combinations that spark inspiration.

* **Cut mechanics from the game** List all the mechanics you are currently using in your game. Try to remove a mechanic and make a game. Ex.:
  * platformer without jumping? Move the ground to help the player character\).
  * Make a deck of the mechanics used and try to find new combinations \(and then create a game with them\). 
* **List of gaming tropes:**  What are the most common in your game type? How can they be avoided? Haw can you use them to surprise the gamer?
