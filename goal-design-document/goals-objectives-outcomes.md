# Goals, Objectives, Outcomes

You could have simple sentences explaining each point, or formalize each point in the format Goal / Objective / Outcome, where: 

* **Goal** - why are we going to do this?. A big objective or general statement. Should be used as the target of all the work being made by the members involved with the game development.  Usually it will have one or more objectives directly tied to it and have a broad scope \(though not always\).
  * To become a marked leader.
  * To be identified has a fun game.
  * To reach number one in store sales. 
* **Objective** - what is expected to happen? Steps that have to be made to reach the goal.  Should be specific and achieved within a time frame.
  * Sell 10000 units in first 24 hours of release.
  * Every month release X updates dealing with top user requests.
  * Have X articles/posts on websites in the week X so the game can reach number 1 in the store. 
* **Expected outcomes** - how to track if the goal and objectives are progressing positively. 
  * Have positive brand recognition reflected in google analytics data.
  * Have /maintain a positive relation with players.
  * Have reviews \(news/social/posts\) keep sales alive past the first 24 hours.
