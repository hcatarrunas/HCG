## Why make this game?

At the end of the day when your tired and uninspired, when you ask "why i am doing this" what is it that made you start creating the game?

* **Personal use?**

  * Maybe you just can't find games with something that appeals to you?
  * Maybe it's just something you want to have fun with?

* **Source of income?**
  * Use it to gain some extra income?
  * Make the development your main source of income? 
* **School project?**
  * As a direct answer to a class need? 
  * As a different way to present a project/content in class? 
* **Friends or family?**
  * Gift / experience to give someone?
  * As a way to spend time / work together with someone? 
* **Company client or partner?**
  * Direct request from the client for a specific game?
  * Use some funding to help the client attain an X goal in a different way?

Trying to have a clear goal should help you to remain focused / motivated /oriented when some things start to slog or some kind of roadblock is hit.

It's also important to consider that things can sometimes change outside of your control.  
Maybe a client asked for a platformer for their company mascot and now wants a RPG illustrating the how green the company is. Or the budget to pay for the game gets cut and it becomes impossible to deliver what is being asked.

In this cases your have to calmly consider why you started your game, what you hoped to achieve, how things are changing and if it's still worth it to continue or if you should just stop the project.
