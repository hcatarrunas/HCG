# Vision

## Defining company vision

A company vision will usually be set by the company leadership and should affect the decisions about:

* Defining goals for the company in the long term.
* Defining best practices in product management.
* Defining best practices in project management.
* Defining best practices in the work space.
* Profiling new hires for the company.

## Goals and company vision

Ideally a company vision should always be a little beyond the reach of the company, or something that that will be an eternal ongoing effort. It should be something that everyone can agree with, and tries to move the company closer to, each and every day.

## Work force and company vision

The company vision should allow all workers to know how their work is contributing to advance the company closer to its ultimate goal.  
They should innately respect this vision when doing day to day tasks or when planning work goals, serving as examples of everyone in the company.
