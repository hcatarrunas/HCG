# Constraints and opportunities

### Is someone paying for this project?

* **What do they need?**

  * Are we keeping in touch with them?
  * Are we seeking approval about the work being done?
  * Are we confirming their current needs are still the same that existed at the beginning of the project?

* **Are there multiple clients paying?**

  * Do all the clients have the same weight in the decisions?
  * Do all the clients agree about the work being done?
  * Do all the clients agree about what is to be delivered at the end?

* **Is there anything that could make the project fail for this external client?**
  * Can someone above make decisions that could make the project fail?
  * Are there any laws that could make the project fail if not followed?
  * Are there any elements that could make the project fail?
    * Specific event or place that could become unavailable?
    * Usage of hardware/software that could be discontinued?
    * Trend that could disappear by launch date?

### Is there something that can be improved?

* Are the needs of the project still being answered in the best way?
  * Has the market changed because of a competitor product?
  * Have the users started to lose interest in this kind of products?
  * Has a more convenient way to answer the user needs appeared?
  * Has something else eliminated the need for the product?
