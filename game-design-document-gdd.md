  What is a Game Design Document, and why you should try to create it before
  starting a game?

# Game Design Document \(GDD\) \*

The term Game Design Document \(GDD\) is commonly and loosely applied to any documentation used to align all the work involved in the creation of the game.

The GDD should always be created before starting development.

* It should provide a starting point to explain the game idea to yourself, to a team or to a publisher/partner.
* It is a central reference point that should provide the information needed by everyone involved with the game, in such a way  as to bring confidence that they knows how their work is contributing to reach the expected final product. 
* It can be used as an historic reference when doing an analysis of how a ongoing project \(or finished project\), is being developed compared with how it was projected to be developed.
* It should be prepared in a way that each team member can find the relevant information for them, from:
  * the idea originators - to explain the game to someone.
  * the development team - to explain how the game will work.
  * the art and sound/music team - to explain what the game mood will be.
  * the marketing team - to explain how the player will find the game and what their first experience will be.
  * the distribution team - to explain ways the players will be able to acquire the game.

## GDD contents

Although a GDD could be as simple as a one page word document describing the game 

## GDD recommended usage

Usually a GDD is used in one of two ways:

* **Incremental documentation**

  * Usually when the game is developed for an external client to the development team. This means every possible change has to be approved by multiple sources.
  * Could also be used if the team is going to make a new game that is very similar to a game that was create previously. 
  * The first version of the GDD is agreed upon before the game production starts, and is used to plan/estimate the game development that will be made.
  * Feedback is collected and at regular intervals is used to create a new GDD version proposal \(by the dev team, client or third party\).
  * The new version of the GDD is reviewed and if approved, results in programmed changes for the game production.

* **Live documentation \(smaller teams or new kind of product\)**
  * First version is agreed upon before the game production starts.
  * Feedback is sent to one element of the team that reviews it and chooses if it is to be updated in the GDD.
  * When the GDD is updated the team is informed of the changes, and makes the necessary changes in the game production.
