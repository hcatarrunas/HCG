# Introduction \*

## Where to start

Try to identify 5-10 market leaders \(or just games you like\), and do a breakdown of the gameplay elements and how the game art presents them to the player.

To make your game stand out try to create variations of each system and variations of how it's shown to the player \(the most different the better\), then prototype them in mini games.

Test your game variations with players and see what seems to be considered the most fun. Try to eliminate the less fun elements and improve the most fun elements, then test again with the players.
