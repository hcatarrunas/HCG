  In a game Gameplay Design is generally considered as encompassing all aspects
  related with how objects in the game interact with each other.

# Introduction \*

## Where to start

* When finishing the game should look good, feel good, sound good, and play good.
* Macro Design
* Micro Design

Try to identify 5-10 market leaders \(or just games you like\), and do a breakdown of the gameplay elements and how the game art presents them to the player.



To make your game stand out try to create variations of each system and variations of how it's shown to the player \(the most different the better\), then prototype them in mini games.

* Identify individual mechanics and game loops
* Prototype mechanics and game loops
* Test mechanics and game loops with players
* Identify player interest, pain points, improvements or new ideas
* Prototype a middle game level with full mechanics and game loops
* Test mechanics with players
* Remove mechanics and see player reaction till you can't remove anything
* Finish first level last, after establishing players like the game loops and mechanics
* First 15 minutes of game have to hook players with the introduction of game loops and mechanics

Test your game variations with players and see what seems to be considered the most fun. Try to eliminate the less fun elements and improve the most fun elements, then test again with the players.
