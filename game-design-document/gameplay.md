# Gameplay contexts \*

 Some examples of common game contexts:

* Combat: 
  * Turn-based
  * Real-time
* Exposition
  * Cinematics
  * Info exchange \(ex. on-screen dialog text, voice over\)
* UI reflection:
  * Menus,
  * Screens about information \(ex. character screen\),
  * Screens about choice \(ex. item store\)

## The importance of respecting \(expected\) game context

A game should always consider what the player is expecting to be doing in the next interaction.  
If a player is having fun while combating some enemies then the game designer should take seriously any kind of change in the game context that could break the player immersion. \(ex. stop combat for a dialogue exchange\)

This doesn't mean the game has to always keep the same game context in a session, but that any change in the context should be carefully considered, and tested with players, to make certain it improves the gameplay. 

## Examples of game context change

* Combat » To management \(ex. in Diablo stopping to manage Player stats, Skills, Items/equipment\)
* Exploration » To combat \(ex. Mass effect going from ship to mission\)
* Exploration » To combat \(ex. Heroes might magic from map to combat\)
