# Gameplay contexts



 Some examples of common game contexts:

* Combat: 
  * Turn-based
  * Real-time
* Exposition
  * Cinematics
  * Info exchange \(ex. on-screen dialog text, voice over\)
* UI reflection:
  * Menus,
  * Screens about information \(ex. character screen\),
  * Screens about choice \(ex. item store\)

### The importance of respecting expected game context

A game should always consider what the player is expecting to be doing in the next interation.
