# UX

We are considering UX \(User Experience\) as the focus on identifying what the users are expecting of the game and what they hope it will have in the future.  
After having identified this points the person responsible by UX will formalize this points in documents to present them for discussion with team and hopefully create work tasks for the future.

To identify this points the UX designer should have good interaction with users through:

* user testing \(ex. early access\)
* user behavior analytics \(ex. identifying key metrics and reviewing them periodically\)
* focus groups \(ex. forum discussions\)
* surveys \(ex. social media posts followers\)
